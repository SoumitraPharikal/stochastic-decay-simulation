# Stochastic Simulation of Probabilistic Decay Pathways Using Discrete Monte Carlo Sampling

This project simulates the radioactive decay process using discrete-time Monte Carlo techniques. It analyzes how statistical noise scales with population size by computing RMS deviations from the analytical decay law, and presents both absolute and normalized error trends over varying initial populations \( N_0 \in [10, 10^4] \).
